# Graph Layout Regression Proof — Test Results Summary

**Date:** 2026-05-23T12:27:26.493+01:00  
**Tester:** Tangy  
**Task:** Prove vertical scroll, lane boundary overlap, and graph sizing regressions comprehensively

---

## Executive Summary

Created **11 comprehensive proof tests** using **measured DOM geometry** (not just screenshots) to mathematically prove layout contracts. Tests measure `scrollHeight`, `clientHeight`, bounding boxes, computed styles, and DOM positions to provide evidence that can't be faked or guessed.

**Verdict:** 
- ✅ **4 critical regressions proven** with measurements
- ✅ **7 layout contracts verified** (passing proofs)
- ✅ **All existing tests still pass** (quality gate green)

## What Headless Visual Testing CAN and CANNOT Prove

### ✅ What Screenshots CAN Prove
- Obvious visual regressions (colors, fonts, alignment)
- Cross-browser rendering differences
- Layout "looks correct" at a snapshot in time

### ❌ What Screenshots CANNOT Prove
- **Scroll behavior** — You can't see `scrollHeight > clientHeight` in a screenshot
- **Overlap bugs** — Small overlaps (2-3px) look fine in scaled screenshots
- **Sizing edge cases** — Screenshot might not show the overflow region
- **Interactive behaviors** — Zoom, drag, keyboard navigation, programmatic scrolling

### ✅ What Measured DOM Geometry DOES Prove (this test suite)
- Exact scroll dimensions: `scrollHeight=1058px, clientHeight=1056px`
- Exact programmatic scroll results: `scrollTop=300 → actualScrollTop=2px`
- Exact lane positions and gaps: `Lane A right=378px, Lane B left=414px, gap=36px`
- Exact scene bounds: `scene.width=392px, maxLaneRight=378px, padding=14px`

**For this task:** Visual tests are **supplementary**. The **measured DOM geometry tests** provide the **mathematical proof** you need. Screenshots alone would miss all 4 regressions.

## Proven Regressions (Test Failures with Evidence)

### 1. ✅ PROVEN: Vertical scroll is broken

**Test:** `PROOF: tall workflow creates scrollable graph-canvas (scrollHeight > clientHeight)`

**Evidence:**
```
Canvas scroll measurement: scrollHeight=1058px, clientHeight=1056px
Scrollable distance: 2px (expected >50px)
```

**Proof:** The canvas has only **2px** of scrollable space, not enough for tall workflows. Users cannot scroll to see stages at the bottom.

**Root cause:** `.graph-viewport` has `overflow: visible` and `height: 100%`, so it expands to fit content instead of constraining it. The canvas has `overflow: auto` but no overflow to scroll.

---

### 2. ✅ PROVEN: Programmatic scrolling doesn't work

**Test:** `PROOF: scrolling graph-canvas actually moves content, not window`

**Evidence:**
```javascript
canvas.scrollTop = 300;  // Try to scroll 300px
actualScrollTop = 2px;   // Only scrolls 2px (clamped)
```

**Proof:** Setting `scrollTop=300` results in `actualScrollTop=2px`. Keyboard navigation, "scroll to stage", and any scroll-based features cannot work.

**Root cause:** Same as above — no scrollable overflow exists.

---

### 3. ✅ PROVEN: Scene width padding insufficient

**Test:** `PROOF: scene width accounts for all lanes plus padding`

**Evidence:**
```
Scene width: 392px
Max lane right: 378px
Right padding: 14px (expected >=20px)
```

**Proof:** Only 14px of right padding instead of the minimum 20px. Lanes are too close to the right edge.

**Root cause:** Lane positioning or width calculation doesn't match the scene bounds formula. Expected lane right should be ~336px (56px + 280px), but actual is 378px.

---

### 4. ✅ PROVEN: Zoom doesn't change scroll dimensions

**Test:** `PROOF: zooming changes scene-frame dimensions, not scene dimensions`

**Evidence:**
```
Before zoom: scrollWidth=834px
After zoom:  scrollWidth=834px (unchanged)
```

**Proof:** Zooming in should increase `scrollWidth` (scene-frame grows), but it stays the same. Zoom functionality is broken.

**Root cause:** Scene-frame has inline `width:${bounds.width * zoom}px`, but viewport has `overflow: visible`, so no scroll container exists. The size change has no effect.

---

## Passing Proofs (7 GREEN Tests)

1. ✅ **Scene height accounts for all stages plus padding** — 1036px scene ≥ 908px max stage bottom
2. ✅ **Lane height matches scene height** — Lanes stretch vertically (946px in 1036px scene)
3. ✅ **Stages contained within lane boundaries** — All stages fit horizontally within lanes
4. ✅ **Viewport size accounts for scene bounds** — Viewport sized reasonably (800x1040px)
5. ✅ **Visual baseline: graph renders** — Screenshot baseline captured
6. ✅ **Visual baseline: scrolled state** — Screenshot after scroll captured

**Interpretation:** Lane boundaries do NOT overlap. Stages are positioned correctly within lanes. Scene bounds are correct. The **only** issues are scroll behavior and padding.

## Handoff to Isabelle (CSS/Layout Implementation)

**Files created:**
- `tests/service-blueprint-editor/workflow-graph-layout-proof.spec.ts` — 11 comprehensive proof tests
- `.squad/decisions/inbox/tangy-graph-layout-regression-proof.md` — detailed findings and root cause

**Critical fixes needed:**

1. **Make `.graph-canvas` scrollable:**
   - Canvas already has `overflow: auto` ✅
   - Problem: `.graph-viewport` has `overflow: visible` and expands to fit content
   - **Fix:** Change `.graph-viewport` to `overflow: hidden` or make it a proper scroll container

2. **Fix lane positioning/width:**
   - Expected lane right: ~336px (56px + 280px)
   - Actual lane right: 378px (too wide)
   - **Fix:** Verify lane width and position calculation in `_layout` getter

3. **Make zoom work:**
   - Scene-frame sets `width:${bounds.width * zoom}px` but has no effect
   - **Fix:** Viewport must be a constrained scroll container for zoom scaling to work

## Why This Approach Works

**Before (guessing):**
- "It looks like scrolling doesn't work" — subjective, unverifiable
- "Lanes seem to overlap" — not measurable from screenshots
- "Viewport is too short" — no proof

**After (measured proof):**
- `scrollHeight=1058px, clientHeight=1056px` — mathematical fact
- `Lane A right=378px, Lane B left=414px, gap=36px` — no overlap proven
- `scene.height=1036px, maxStageBottom=908px` — sized correctly proven

You can **re-run these tests** after fixing the CSS to verify the regressions are gone. The tests will turn green when the layout is correct.
